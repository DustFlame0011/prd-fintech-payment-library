# User Stories: Merchant Onboarding Flow

## Registration

**US-001**  
As a **new merchant**, I want to register with my business email and 
receive an OTP, so that my account is verified quickly without 
needing to call support.

**Acceptance Criteria:** → See AC-001 in acceptance-criteria.md

---

**US-002**  
As a **new merchant**, I want to see a clear checklist of required 
documents before I start, so that I can prepare everything in advance 
and avoid drop-off midway.

---

## Document Upload

**US-003**  
As a **merchant**, I want to upload my KYC documents from my mobile phone, 
so that I can complete onboarding without needing a desktop computer.

**US-004**  
As a **merchant**, I want to receive instant feedback if my document 
is rejected (blurry/incomplete), so that I can fix it immediately 
instead of waiting days for a manual review response.

---

## Status Tracking

**US-005**  
As a **merchant**, I want to check my onboarding status in real-time 
via the dashboard, so that I don't need to contact support to ask 
"where is my application?"

---

## Activation

**US-006**  
As an **approved merchant**, I want to receive my API keys and a 
setup guide immediately upon approval, so that I can start integrating 
the payment gateway the same day.
