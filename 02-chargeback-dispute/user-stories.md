# User Stories: Chargeback Dispute Flow

### Notification & Awareness

**US-001**  
As a **merchant**, I want to receive a real-time in-app notification and email when a new chargeback is filed against my account, so that I am aware immediately and can begin gathering evidence before the deadline.

**US-002**  
As a **merchant**, I want to see a clear countdown timer showing how many days remain to respond to each dispute, so that I never miss a response deadline.

**US-003**  
As a **merchant**, I want to receive automated reminder notifications at 7 days, 3 days, and 24 hours before each response deadline, so that urgent cases are escalated to my attention.

### Evidence Submission

**US-004**  
As a **merchant**, I want the system to tell me exactly what evidence I should submit based on the chargeback reason code, so that I don't submit irrelevant documents and reduce my win rate.

**US-005**  
As a **merchant**, I want to upload multiple evidence files (receipts, delivery confirmations, communication logs, terms of service) in a single submission, so that I can build a complete case without multiple back-and-forth interactions.

**US-006**  
As a **merchant**, I want to preview my evidence package before final submission and add a written rebuttal letter, so that I can review my case from the card network's perspective before it is sent.

### Case Management

**US-007**  
As a **merchant**, I want to view all active, pending, won, and lost chargeback cases in a single dashboard with filter and search capabilities, so that I can prioritise and manage my dispute workload efficiently.

**US-008**  
As a **merchant**, I want to see the full transaction details for each dispute (date, amount, cardholder name, reason code) alongside the case, so that I can match it to my own records without leaving the platform.

**US-009**  
As an **enterprise merchant**, I want to export my chargeback history as a CSV file filtered by date range, status, and reason code, so that I can reconcile disputes in my own accounting system.

### Compliance Team

**US-010**  
As a **compliance officer**, I want to see all open cases across all merchants in a centralised queue, with priority flagging for cases approaching deadline, so that I can intervene when merchants have not responded.
